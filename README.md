## Testing

### Manual Vs Automated Testing

- I opted to **manually** test my site.  The reasons are -  

    1. 
    2. 
    3. 
    4. 

- Reasons why I would use Automated Testing in the future for other projects.

    1. Larger scale site or application that may have multiple pages and an increased amount of functionality and code. Manual testing would take too long.
    2. Working in a team. Possibly no one person with in-depth knowledge of how the whole site should work and perform. Automated tests would allow anyone to run them.
    3. Continual code added to the site. Automated tests can be run after every addition, ensuring no disruption to the existing code.
    4. Higher accuracy. Important if the site is in the public domain and linked to an organisation. To avoid deprecation of the 'brand' due to a poor website.
    5. Time. Though they take longer to set up initially, having a bespoke automated testing process will save time in the long run, due to how frequently they need to be run when maintaining and improving the site.

    Though the test is a little rudimentary it provided a lot of insight, watching people unfamiliar with the site trying to use it.

### 10-point Manual Test process  

I used a programme called Browserstack to perform the tests. This is software provided as part of the course, included in the Student Developer pack.  

The application recommended that 1 x high-end, 1 x low-end device and a tablet is tested for each main manufacturer of smart devices.  I've tested Apple, Samsung, and Google.  

Also, I've tested the site on a broad cross-section of browsers.  Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox.  

Here are the devices/browsers and a screenshot of the front page of my site.  
<img align = "center" width = "300px" height = "200px" src = "">  


The 10-points are as follows -

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively, Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now-published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

# [Balanced Diet Meal Finder](https://mealplanner-2.herokuapp.com/)

![mockup](mealplanner/wireframes/bdrf-mockup.png)

[View the live project here.](https://mealplanner-2.herokuapp.com/)

I love food.  I mean I *really* love it.

I love eating food, who doesnt? but also I love reading about it, I love learning about it and of course I love cooking it too.  As such I took it upon myself to devise a weekly meal plan for my small family and have been doing so for a while now.

I aim for the meals to be healthy, balanced, interesting and of course tasty!  Sounds simple right?  

But it's not... firstly it's very time consuming. 

I turn to my long tried-and-tested recipes which can be found either online, in my numerous cookbooks (which are in no-particular-order), 10 year old scraps of paper pulled from a sunday paper supplements (covered in sauce and flattened tomatoes) or finally, and more recently, in those free binders given to you on your first subscription to Gusto or Hello Fresh.  This all takes time. 

Also, with so much information around about what consists of a balanced, healthy, nutrious diet, it can feel confusing and overwhelming to say the least.  Who really knows if they're eating enough oily fish in their diet??

OK to summarise why I've created the Balanced Diet Meal Finder. 
- You have all your favourite recipes in one place, saving you time.
- Categorised into food groups. Vegetarian, White Meat, Red Meat, Oily Fish and White Fish to help you choose a nice balanced diet.

## User Experience (UX)

The project was created in order to fulfil the critera of the L5 Diploma in Web Application Development that I'm completing. This is for Unit 3: Back End Development.

The unit aims to provide knowledge and skills needed to build a Back end web application. Topics include data storage and data management using either relational or non-relational databases.

The idea came several years ago but then it was in paper form.  I had started to try and jot down any recipes our family enjoyed, categorised into different food groups. Essentially it was a plastic folder with dividers, separating several bits of paper all with the aim of saving me time, but also ensuring we eat a balanced diet.  

This units project criteria was the perfect opportunity to move the data (recipes) on to a user-friendly app!

### Design  

#### Colour Scheme

I wanted some vivid colours that come from produce so have I have used avocado green and reddish pinks that I feel compliment each other well.
- ![#DED369](https://via.placeholder.com/15/DED369/DED369) `#DED369` (**Avocado Green**)
- ![#F8EFEA](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F8EFEA/F8EFEA) `#F8EFEA` (**Pink**)
- ![#E0475B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/E0475B/E0475B) `#E0475B` (**Coral**)

#### Typography

- I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my application. 

-For the front page navbar brand header I used :-

- [Fredoka One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One)

-For the food group headers, card texts and nav links I used :-

- [Volkhov](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Volkhov)

#### Icons

- [Font Awesome 6.3.0](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - These where used for the chilli icons in the navbar and for the individual form fields.

### Wireframes

## The Database

For the App the majority of the data is contained within the Recipe table.  The Category table is to allow separation of the recipes but is of course related to the main recipes.  The Cuisine table is there for future development, to allow filtration of the cuisine type of the recipe.

<img align = "center" width = "300px" height = "200px" src = "mealplanner/wireframes/bdrf-databaseschema.png">

**Category**
```
id: <Integer>
food_category: <string>
```

**Cuisine**
```
id: <Integer>
recipe_cuisine: <String>
```

**Recipe**
```
id: <Integer>
recipe_name: <String>
recipe_notes: <Text>
cook_time: <Time>
recipe_location: <Text>
family_friendly : <Boolean>
recipe_healthy: <Boolean>

## **TESTING** ##

### Manual Vs Automated Testing

- I opted to **manually** test my site.  The reasons are -  

    1. As the sole developer I can quickly carry out tests as I go and can obtain immediate results from the test.
    2. As the main purpose of the site is to learn about Back End Development, show understanding and gain a qualification; and won't need to be maintained in the long term, I felt the time it would take to build an automated testing process was unnecessary on this occasion.  In a real-world situation, the use of a test framework, such as Jest would be invaluable to ensure the continiuous integrity of the site.
    3. UX testing. Important to the overall usability of the site and can only be carried out via manual testing. Automated testing lacks human observation and cognitive abilities.

- Reasons why I would use Automated Testing in the future for other projects.

    1. Larger scale site or application that may have an increased amount of functionality and code. Manual testing would take too long.
    2. Working in a team. Possibly no one person with in-depth knowledge of how the whole site should work and perform. Automated tests would allow anyone to run them.
    3. Continual code added to the site. Automated tests can be run after every addition, ensuring no disruption to the existing code.
    4. Higher accuracy. Important if the site is in the public domain and linked to an organisation. To avoid deprecation of the 'brand' due to a poor website.
    5. Time. Though they take longer to set up initially, having a bespoke automated testing process will save time in the long run, due to how frequently they need to be run when maintaining and improving the site.



### Manual Test process  

  - The Test  
1. All navbar links work.
1. Home/Category page loads a 'Random recipe' of the correct food category. Check all 5.
1. All accordians work as expected across all 5 category html pages.
1. 'Add recipe' page opens with form to complete and all fields work as expected
1. 'Add recipe' button adds to the database and user is directed to the correct relevant recipe page, with feedback confirming the recipe has been added.
1. Edit button opens the edit_recipe page with form pre-populated with existing information.
1. 'Save Changes' button updates database with the changes made and user is directed to the correct, relevant page, with feedback confirming the recipe has been updated.
1. Delete button produces a modal to confirm user wants to proceed. If selects ok the user receives feedback confirming the deletion.
1. All pages work on different size screens, different browsers and devices

### Outcomes

<img align = "center" width = "500px" height = "350px" src = "mealplanner/static/images/testing/manual-testing-matrix.png"> 

I used a programme called Browserstack to perform the tests. This is software provided as part of the course, included in the Student Developer pack.  This software allows you to load your site on a live environment on each device and browser.

The application recommended that 1 x high-end, 1 x low-end device and a tablet is tested for each main manufacturer of smart devices.  I've tested Apple and Samsung devices of differing sizes.  

Also, I've tested the site on a broad cross-section of browsers.  Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox.

The site performed well across all devices and browsers. All links worked as expected.  Appearance and layout looked good on all devices too.

## **BUGS** ##
1. If a user incorrectly input 60mins or over in the minute field for the cook time a DataError was produced.
<img align = "center" width = "200px" height = "100px" src = "mealplanner/static/images/testing/bdrf-bug-over60mins.png">
2. When editing a recipe the cook time wasnt pre-populating, remaining empty.
3. If user clicks on 'Get random recipe' button, though it worked the variable stored the recipe.  Meaning if the user clicked it over & over again it would show the same recipe. 
4.  When deploying my original app I ran in to a problem with the database.  It wasn't creating the database and linking to the app.  After many hours trying to resolve I copied over the code on to a new workspace and re-attempted the deployment.  Unfortunately my 'commits' will be linked to that original Repo ["mealplanner.2"](https://github.com/nddpj00/mealplanner.2)

## Fixes
1. The dataerror was due to using the incorrect datatype I believe.  In the form I chaned the type to "time" and this resolved it immediately.
2. The data stored in the database was in the incorrect format.  By added 0 before the value on the html resolved this. ie value="0{{ recipe.cook_time }}" .
3. I added some Javascript to reload the page on the 'close' button to allow a new recipe to be set as random.

### Known Bugs
No known bugs

## **DEPLOYMENT** ##

Deployment of the site was achieved by following the steps below :

- Create a managed database with [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)
- Created a requirements.txt file by typing "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt" in the terminal which tells Heroku what dependencies are required.
- Created a Procfile in the root directory of my project and inside the file added the following command; web: python run.py
- Open __init__.py file and added an if statement before the line setting the SLQALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and, in the else, set the value to reference a new variable, DATABASE_URL.
- To ensure that SQLAlchemy can read my external database, the URL needs to start with “postgresql://”, to do this I made an addition to by else statement from the previous step to adjust the DATABASE_URL in case it starts with postgres://:
- Save, add, commit and push to Github.
- Logged in to Heroku and selected "Create New App".
- Selected the input field "App Name" and gave app a unique name using dashes instead of spaces.
- Selected the region closest to my location.
- Clicked "Create App".
- Selected "Settings" from the Heroku App menu.
- Copy database URL from ElephantSQL.
- On Heroku, add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste the ElephantSQL database URL in the value, then click Add.
- Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var
- Selected "Deploy" from the Heroku App menu.
- Scrolled down the page and selected "Enable Automatic Deployment".
- Selected Master Branch under "Branch Selected".
- Clicked "Deploy Branch"
- Next I needed to add my tables to my database. Click 'More' and select 'Run console'
- Type python3 into the console and click Run
- input in terminal - from mealplanner import db - db.create_all() - exit()
-'Open app' will then open my app.

### <ins>HOSTING</ins>

The site is hosted on [Heroku](https://mealplanner-2.herokuapp.com/).


### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively, Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now-published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

- Navigate to my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/nddpj00/balanced-diet-menu-finder).
- Click the "Code" button next to the Green Gitpod button.
- Either, download the zip file or clone the repo using gh repo clone nddpj00/balanced-diet-menu-finder in the terminal.
- Install the modules listed in the requirements.txt file using "python -m pip -r requirements.txt" in the terminal.
- Create an env.py file in your application folder and add the following:

    ```
    import os

    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "********")
    os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "False")
    os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
    os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "postgresql:///mealplanner")
    ```

  You will need to update the above with  your own SECRET_KEY and YOUR ROOT info.

- The app can now be run locally by typing python run.py in the terminal and will be available in your browser using the address "http://localhost:5000".
